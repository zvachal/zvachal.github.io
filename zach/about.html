        My name is Zachary Vachal. Zachary Henry Zivitz Vachal to be exact. I also hope to add 'Burke' to my list of names, in honor of my mother's side of the family, but that is a different story. My story though, begins on October 21, 2001. I don't remember much of anything from my first years, but I am told that I was a more reserved child, and that I didn't cry much, maybe I was saving that for later. My first memory was surprisingly cliche. I was at Disneyland. Now, looking back to my two year old self, I was probably very scared, that may have been what shocked my memory into motion. I was on a red rollercoaster, traveling in a downward slope, and looking at my shoes. Maybe I just happened to be interested in my shoes at that moment, but I remember them surprisingly well. They were a bland shade of brown, with blue and red lining the tongue, not the most handsome shoes, but apparently pretty enough to entertain a two year old while he plummets toward the ground on his first ever roller coaster. I am currently 13.865249 according to my "motivation" google chrome app, and I am five foot eleven inches. I hope to be six foot four in my life, just as a personal preference. My favorite place in the world is Vermont, which I will talk about later, and I have two brothers, Jackson, 16 and Nate, 7. So far I have had a pretty great life, and I'll tell you why.

        My first school was Rosenburg pre-school, near the JCCSF. Oh, I loved that place. My memories there consist of mostly having a blast. I remember meeting my first friends there, and getting to play all day, which now a days would be a dream come true! After graduating from Rosenberg, I continued on to Lafayette Elementary, which despite the name, is in San Francisco. At that little place on 37th Avenue and Anza, I became the boy I am today. I had the greatest teachers ever, and I met my bestest friend, Akala, who I still hang out with today. Our meeting was not exactly conventional, in fact we were worst enemies in the beginning. We would get into fights on the play yard, most of which I provoked. I believe our initial argument consisted of me making fun of him for his long hair. After a few years we ended up as best friends. I don't know where it happened along the line, but after that, we both became better kids, and I actually remember sticking up for kids who got bullied in my school. I was a conflict manager in my school for four years (The most possible) and I was always the mediator in childish arguments on the school yard. My kindergarten teacher, Mrs. Powers (though her name is now Mrs. Chambers, she will always be Mrs. Powers to me) was the greatest influence on my five year old self I could have asked for. She introduced math, science, english, and many more subjects to me, but she also gave me my first responsibilities. In about third grade, I discovered Taekwondo. I started classes at the Navarrete's Black belt academy, and it changed my life. I worked harder than I ever had before and learned perseverance, attitude, and confidence at the classes I took. I ended up teaching kids in the leadership program, with a second degree black belt I had worked for more than four years to achieve. It was at the time, my pride and joy. My fifth grade teacher, Mrs. Welsh was my favorite teacher of all time. I do not believe she could ever be topped in my book. Not a day went by in her class where she got the whole class to laugh at one of her ingenious songs, or just her great attitude towards all her students. I learned so much about both my subjects, and myself that year, and I had the best time doing it. She was smiling every second, and I like to think that some of her confidence, care, and kindness rubbed off onto me.

        I would have stayed in that fifth grade class for the rest of my life, but I did, or at least my parents said I had to, continue my education. I applied to a few middle schools, and I surprisingly got into all but one, and so I had the choice. I could go to the school where all of my friends were going, Presidio, or I could go to Brandeis, the school close enough to my house that I could actually walk there. The drive to Presidio would have been hard on my parents, and I felt like I would ultimately get a better education at Brandeis, so evidently, I decided I would attend Brandeis Hillel Day School. I left my friends behind, and lost a few, to never talk again (so far), and that was hard, very hard on my eleven year old conscious. It may have not even worked out if it weren't for a few people I met at Brandeis. Dylan Lukanovich, Aiden Sagerman, and Ari Kishinevsky went out of their way to welcome me into my new school. They were the ones I could always talk to and laugh with, and are still some of the only people I trust with my problems and I always can count on. So, I started school, with all my new teachers, and new schedule, and new expectations. In my seventh grade year, I did harder and more work than I have ever done before, and I'm sure the same will go for my eighth grade year, and honestly, it was fun. I shared my issues with my newfound friends, and I met new people, and developed into a person that I am very proud to be today. In the midst of this chaos of middle school, I had a new problem. I just discovered a new passion of mine, rowing crew, but participating in this sport meant quitting Taekwondo, which I had worked on for such a large piece of my life. It was a very hard decision, but I ended up quitting Taekwondo and joining the Pacific Rowing Club. I started the non-competitive program, and after two years I began on their Novice team, where I am now.

        Rowing, I have found, is of the same mentality as Taekwondo, which may be why I love it so much. It requires a very strong will to continue, because the work that counts is the energy you give when you have no more to give. It is one of the hardest sports in the world, and the workouts I do six days a week are comparable to that of U.S military boot camp. I find pride in knowing that there is not a large percentage of people in the world who can do some of the things I am doing. I love rowing, and I think it will become a big part of my life in the years to come, and not only because I am spending 16 hours a week there!

        For the last few summers, my family has traveled. My parents got the idea that my brothers and I should see the world, and I get to go on vacation! We went to all the usual places, Hawaii, and D.C, and then our trips got a bit more interesting. Over the summer of my sixth grade year, we set off for Israel. The plane ride was long, and customs was really long, and then we were there. We did a lot, but my favorite experience was the Western wall. I was intrigued by the history of the enormous wall (pictures don't really capture the full effect). It was hard to think how old it actually was. It is honestly difficult to think about a thousand year period, let alone two. It amazed me how many people and empires, and cultures resided in the Old City. It was all great, but I couldn't help but feel a constant pressure from everyone around me. There was a tension in the air, and always the possibility of a war starting right then and there, it was interesting, but a bit scary.

        This past summer we visited Spain. We stayed in Marbella on La Costa de Sol, the southern coast. We took trips to Sevilla, Granada, and Ronda, and saw amazing sites, ate amazing food, and did a lot of swimming. I don't usually eat fish, but there was some killer calamari! Most of all, I loved the culture. People were so relaxed and laid back everywhere we went. Waiters were generous and kind, and even people on the street had all the time in the world to talk with you, it a great feeling. The whole trip was probably the best I have ever had and I hope to return  for some of that 'European Hospitality'. After that summer, I returned to San Francisco for eighth grade, which I was more excited for than any other year of school in my life. So it began.

        As I previously stated, Vermont is my favorite place in the world. I have visited family in this state for every year of my life, often twice, and it has become a part of me. I can't think of many thing I'd rather be doing than spending time on my aunt's farm, tending to the animals, or on a hike with one of my numerous cousins who live there. Did I mention that my great grandmother had fourteen children? In all I have about seventy-five cousins, and that's only cousins! I have spent so much time at my grandparents cabin in east-Wallingford Vermont that it is a second home for me, and I hope to continue visiting there until the day I die. In fact, right now it sounds like a great place to retire, but that may be too far off to consider. I believe, I have had numerous defining moments in Vermont, moments when I have seen beauty beyond my imagination, and felt more elated than ever before, but one that comes to mind is not of that nature. My great grandmother Betty passed away at age 99, I was 11. My mother and my older brother and I flew out to Vermont for the funeral, my first funeral. Corny enough, I really didn't realize the impact of her passing until I was standing in the aisle at Christ the King Church, while the casket was being carried from the alter. I stood next to my grandmother, Sally, and was surrounded by all my relatives, and it hit me. I lost someone I once embraced with familiar warmth, I lost someone who cared for me.
